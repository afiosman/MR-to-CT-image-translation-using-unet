# Contrast-enhanced MRI synthesis using dense-dilated residual convolutions based 3D network toward elimination of gadolinium in neuro-oncology
Recent studies have raised broad safety and health concerns about using of gadolinium contrast agents during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to enhance identification of active tumors. In this paper, we developed a deep learning-based method for three-dimensional (3D) contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (T1) image synthesis from contrast-free image(s).
